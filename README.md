# hello-world

I’m a software developer and experienced language teacher.

My core experience is in Python, concentrating on natural language processing, as well as backend development in Node. At the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in NYC, a YC-backed programmer community, my projects include a [topic model generator](https://github.com/reeddunkle/Hacker_News_Article_Topics) using latent Dirichlet allocation and keyword extraction, an [in-browser game](https://github.com/reeddunkle/Speed_Pong) with physics simulation, and implementations of [engineering algorithms](https://github.com/reeddunkle/Backtrack_Robot).

I’ve been programming for most of my life. I graduated from Allegheny College where I studied Spanish, psychology, and Java.

### Interests:

Aside from coding, I love music, education, and natural languages! I play the piano, bass guitar, and speak Spanish.
